## Introduction
During my time at University Malaysia Sabah, I noticed a significant inconvenience for students at the start of every semester. To access their subject schedules, they had to navigate the official campus website, which unfortunately offered a poor user experience. With over 800 subjects listed, students were forced to tediously scroll through the extensive catalog just to locate their own schedules. Frustrated by the lack of improvement from the campus management, I took it upon myself to develop a solution that would simplify this process. Determined to create a platform that streamlines the search and organization of subject timetables, I embarked on creating this software during my studies.

## Features
- Searchable Schedule: No more endless scrolling! Quickly locate your subjects with a simple search function, saving you valuable time and effort.
- Build Timetable with a Single Click: Say goodbye to manual scheduling hassles. Construct your personalized timetable effortlessly with just a single click, ensuring optimal organization and planning.

## Installation
Installing the software is a breeze. Simply copy the repository link and clone it to your local machine, or download the ZIP file for quick access.

## Contributing
The software was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making it accessible for any developer with decent knowledge to contribute. Welcome and appreciate contributions from the community to enhance and improve this project.
